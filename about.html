      <h2>About Mananda</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I am Maria Fernanda Chavez, the owner and founder of Mananda Bakery, I came from Venezuela 8 years ago, being a stay-at-home mom, I started some bakery courses, so I could make some good treats for my family and friends. One day I came across a New York style cookie. These are huge cookies filled with cream of different flavors. My friends and family started to order cookies for special occasions and after that I started my own little bakery at home, participating in some of the farmers’ markets around my house until I became recognized as one of the small businesses in the community, even earning Best Dessert of 2025 in the city of Round Rock. To me it is always an honor and give me plenty of joy to share my cookies with you all! If you haven’t tried them, please contact us and check our upcoming events. If you want me to attend one of your events, we will be glad to be there!
